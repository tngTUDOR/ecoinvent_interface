[pypi status]: https://pypi.org/project/ecoinvent_interface/
[tests]: https://github.com/brightway-lca/ecoinvent_interface/actions?workflow=Tests

This is an **unofficial and unsupported** Python library to get ecoinvent data.

# Quickstart

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import Settings, EcoinventRelease, ReleaseType
my_settings = Settings(username="John.Doe", password="example")
release = EcoinventRelease(my_settings)
release.list_versions()
>>> ['3.9.1', '3.9', '3.8', '3.7.1', ...]
release.list_system_models('3.7.1')
>>> ['cutoff', 'consequential', 'apos']
release.get_release(version='3.7.1', system_model='apos', release_type=ReleaseType.ecospold)
>>> PosixPath('/Users/JohnDoe/Library/Application Support/'
              'EcoinventRelease/cache/ecoinvent 3.7.1_apos_ecoSpold02')
```

The ecospold files are downloaded and extracted automatically.

# Usage

## Authentication via `Settings` object

Authentication is done via the `Settings` object. Accessing ecoinvent requires supplying a username and password.

Note that you **must accept** the ecoinvent license and personal identifying information agreement on the website before using your user account via this library.

You can provide credentials in three ways:

* Manually, via arguments to the `Settings` object instantiation:

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import Settings
my_settings = Settings(username="bob", password="example")
```

* Via the `EI_PASSWORD` and `EI_USERNAME` environment variables

```bash
export EI_USERNAME=bob
export EI_PASSWORD=example
```

If your environment variable values have special characters, using single quotes should work, e.g. `export EI_PASSWORD='compl\!cat$d'`.

Followed by:

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import Settings
# Environment variables read automatically
my_settings = Settings()
```

* Or with the use of a [pydantic_settings secrets directory](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/#secrets). The easiest way to create the correct files is via the utility function `permanent_setting`:

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import Settings, permanent_setting
permanent_setting("username", "bob")
permanent_setting("password", "example")
# Secrets files read automatically
my_settings = Settings()
```

Secrets files are stored in `ecoinvent_interface.storage.secrets_dir`.

For each value, manually set values always *take precedence* over environment variables, which in turn *take precendence* over secrets files.

A reasonable guide for choosing between the three is to use secrets on your private, local machine, and to use environment variables on servers or containers.

## `EcoinventRelease` interface

To interact with the ecoinvent website, instantiate `EcoinventRelease`.

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import EcoinventRelease, Settings
my_settings = Settings()
ei = EcoinventRelease(my_settings)
```

### Database releases

To get a database release, we need to make three selections. First, the version:

```python
ei.list_versions()
>>> ['3.9.1', '3.9', '3.8', '3.7.1', ...]
```

Second, the system model:

```python
ei.list_system_models('3.7.1')
>>> ['cutoff', 'consequential', 'apos']
```

The ecoinvent API uses a short and long form of the system model names; you can get the longer names by passing `translate=False`. You can use either form in all `EcoinventRelease` methods.

```python
ei.list_system_models('3.7.1', translate=False)
>>> [
  'Allocation cut-off by classification',
  'Substitution, consequential, long-term',
  'Allocation at the Point of Substitution'
]
```

Finally, the type of release. These are stored in an `Enum`. There are six release types; if you just want the database to do calculations choose the `ecospold` type.

* `ReleaseType.ecospold`: The single-output unit process files in ecospold2 XML format
* `ReleaseType.matrix`: The so-called "universal matrix export"
* `ReleaseType.lci`: LCI data in ecospold2 XML format
* `ReleaseType.lcia`: LCIA data in ecospold2 XML format
* `ReleaseType.cumulative_lci`: LCI data in Excel
* `ReleaseType.cumulative_lcia`: LCIA data in Excel

See the ecoinvent website for more information on what these values mean.

Once we have made a selection for all three choices, we can get the release files. They are saved to a cache directory and extracted by default.

```python
ei.get_release(version='3.7.1', system_model='apos', release_type=ReleaseType.matrix)
>>> PosixPath('/Users/JohnDoe/Library/Application Support/'
              'EcoinventRelease/cache/universal_matrix_export_3.7.1_apos')
```

The default cache uses [platformdirs](https://platformdirs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the directory location is OS-dependent. You can use a custom cache directory with by specifying `output_dir` when creating the `Settings` class instance.

You can work with the cache when offline:

```python
cs = CachedStorage()
list(cs.catalogue)
>>> ['ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation.7z']
cs.catalogue['ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation.7z']
>>> {
  'path': '/Users/<your username>/Library/Application Support/'
          'EcoinventRelease/cache/ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation',
  'extracted': True,
  'created': '2023-09-03T20:23:57.186519'
}
```

### `EcoinventRelease` *extra* files

There are two other kinds of files available: *reports*, and what we call *extra* files. Let's see the *extra* files for version `'3.7.1'`:

```python
ei.list_extra_files('3.7.1')
>>>  {'ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation.7z': {
    'uuid': ...,
    'size': ...,
    'modified': datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 25, 0, 0)
  },
  ...
}
```

This returns a dictionary of filenames and metadata. We can download the `ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation.7z` file; by default it will automatically be extracted.


```python
ei.get_extra(version='3.7.1', filename='ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation.7z')
>>> PosixPath('/Users/<your username>/Library/Application Support'
              '/EcoinventRelease/cache/ecoinvent 3.7.1_LCIA_implementation')
```

### `EcoinventRelease` *reports*

Reports require a login but not a version number:

```python
ei.list_report_files()
>>> {
  'Allocation, cut-off, EN15804_documentation.pdf': {
    'uuid': ...,
    'size': ...,
    'modified': datetime.datetime(2021, 10, 1, 0, 0),
    'description': ('This document provides a documentation on the calculation '
                    'of the indicators in the “Allocation, cut-off, EN15804” '
                    'system model.')
  }
}
```

Downloading follows the same pattern as before:

```python
ei.get_report('Allocation, cut-off, EN15804_documentation.pdf')
>>> PosixPath('/Users/<your username>/Library/Application Support/EcoinventRelease/cache/Allocation, cut-off, EN15804_documentation.pdf')
```

Zip and 7z files are extracted by default.

## `EcoinventProcess` interface

This class gets data and reports for specific processes. It first needs to know what release version and system model to work with:

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import EcoinventProcess, Settings
my_settings = Settings()
ep = EcoinventProcess(my_settings)
ep.set_release(version="3.7.1", system_model="apos")
```

### Finding a dataset id

The ecoinvent API uses integer indices, and these values aren't found in the release values. We have cached these indices for versions `3.7.1`, `3.8`, and `3.9.1`. If you already know the integer index, you can use that:

```python
ep.select_process(dataset_id="1")
```

You can also use the filename, if you know it:

```python
F = "b0eb27dd-b87f-4ae9-9f69-57d811443a30_66c93e71-f32b-4591-901c-55395db5c132.spold"
ep.select_process(filename=F)
ep.dataset_id
>>> "1"
```

Finally, you can pass in a set of `attributes`. You should use the name, reference product, and/or location to uniquely identify a process. You don't need to give all attributes, but will get an error if the attributes aren't specific enough.

`attributes` is a dictionary, and can take the following keys: `name` or `activity_name`, `reference product` or `reference_product`, and `location` or `geography`. The system will adapt the names as needed to find a match.

```python
ep.select_process(
    attributes={
        "name": "rye seed production, Swiss integrated production, for sowing",
        "location": "CH",
        "reference product": "rye seed, Swiss integrated production, for sowing",
    }
)
ep.dataset_id
>>> "40"
```

### Basic process information

Once you have selected the process, you can get basic information about that process:

```python
ep.get_basic_info()
>>> {
  'index': 1,
  'version': '3.7.1',
  'system_model': 'apos',
  'activity_name': 'electricity production, nuclear, boiling water reactor',
  'geography': 'FI',
  'reference_product': 'electricity, high voltage',
  'has_access': True
}
 ```

You can also call `ep.get_documentation()` to get a representation of the ecospold2 XML file in Python.

### Process documents

You can use `ep.get_file` with one of the following file types to download process files:

* ProcessFileType.upr: Unit Process ecospold XML
* ProcessFileType.lci: Life Cycle Inventory ecospold XML
* ProcessFileType.lcia: Life Cycle Impact Assessment ecospold XML
* ProcessFileType.pdf: PDF Dataset Report
* ProcessFileType.undefined: Undefined (unlinked and multi-output) Dataset PDF Report

For example:

```python
from ecoinvent_interface import ProcessFileType
from pathlib import Path
ep.get_file(file_type=ProcessFileType.lcia, directory=Path.cwd())
```

Would download the life cycle impact assessment ecospold XML file to the current working directory. The `get_file` method requires specifying the `directory`.

# Relationship to EIDL

This library initially started as a fork of [EIDL](https://github.com/haasad/EcoInventDownLoader), the ecoinvent downloader. As of version 2.0, it has been completely rewritten. Currently only the authentication code comes from `EIDL`.

Differences with `EIDL`:

* Designed to be a lower-level infrastructure library. All user and web browser interaction was removed.
* Username and password can be specified using [pydantic_settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/).
* Can download all release files, plus reports and "extra" files.
* Will autocorrect filenames when possible for ecoinvent inconsistencies.
* Can download data on inventory processes.
* Can find inventory processes using their filename or attributes.
* Uses a more robust caching and cache validation strategy.
* More reasonable token refresh strategy.
* No HTML parsing or filename string hacks.
* Streaming downloads.
* Descriptive logging and error messages.
* No shortcuts for Brightway or other LCA software.
* Custom library headers are set to allow users of this library to be identified. No user information is transmitted.
* Comprehensive tests.
